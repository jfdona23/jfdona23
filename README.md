### Welcome to my repo! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Juan Fernando and I'm a passionate and curious creature that's always looking to learn something interesting and new. \
Currently I'm working as a Infrastructure Consultant in one of the greatest places to work here in Spain!. \
In my free time I try to expand my horizons, gain new skills or learn about new technologies that could be helpful for the team, and also for my own personal and professional growth. \
I'm a chatty person so feel free to reach out and let's have a (virtual) coffee!
