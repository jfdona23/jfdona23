### Welcome to my repo! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Juan Fernando and I'm a passionate and curious person who's always looking to learn something interesting and new. \
Currently, I work as a Tech Lead and Infrastructure Consultant in Barcelona, Spain. \
In my free time I enjoy watching series, having a coffee outside, reading, going for a walk or playing videogames. \
I'm a chatty person so feel free to reach out and let's have a (virtual) coffee!
